## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you get an error about port 5001 being in use:
1. Change the port number in `app.py`
2. Or kill the process using the port:
   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :5001
   kill -9 <PID>
   
   # For Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :5001
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```

### Virtual Environment Issues
If you have problems with the virtual environment:
1. Delete the `venv` directory
2. Re-create it following the installation steps above

### Database Issues
If you encounter database problems:
1. Delete the `contacts.db` file
2. Restart the application to create a fresh database

## Deactivating Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project:
```bash
deactivate
```
